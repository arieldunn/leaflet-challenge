United States Geological Survey: Visual Representation of the Relationship Between Tectonic Plates and Seismic Activity

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.
A map has been created to visualize all data by using Leaflet.js. The map plots all of the earthquakes from the USGS data set based on their longitude and latitude and illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
